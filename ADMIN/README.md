# ADMIN/

Small placeholder admin UI folder.

## Current state

- `package.json` exists, but there are no scripts configured beyond the default placeholder.
- `app.js` is currently empty.
- `public/index.html` is currently empty.

## Intended use (suggested)

This folder can be used for a simple web UI to:

- show router status (read-only)
- generate/issue Telegram authorisation codes
- manage users/roles in MongoDB

If you want, I can scaffold a minimal Express app + a basic HTML dashboard here.
